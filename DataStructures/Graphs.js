/*
Graphs are collections of things and the relationships or connections between them.
The data in a graph are called nodes or vertices. The connections between the nodes are called edges.

- Directed Graphs: graphs with a direction in its edges (ex. links, webpages)

- Undirected Graphs: graphs without any direction on the edges between nodes (ex. social network: nodes can be friends)

Adjacency List (a->b->c)
Adjacency Matrix (a<-b<-c):  2D array uses both rows, columns to represent nodes and edges
Incidence Matrix: 2D array uses rows to represent nodes in the columns to represent edges, can have uneven rows/columns
