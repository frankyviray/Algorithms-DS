//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// Breadth-First Search

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// Breadth-First Search: Since DFS will take a long time especially since solutions are rare.
// DFS uses recursive so time will take very long.

//If the tree is very wide:
// Depth-First Search: BFS will need too much memory since it has to keep track of the nodes in the current level (queue).

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// Depth-First Search

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// Depth-First Search is built for.

//Finding the shortest path:
// Breadth-First Search is built for.
