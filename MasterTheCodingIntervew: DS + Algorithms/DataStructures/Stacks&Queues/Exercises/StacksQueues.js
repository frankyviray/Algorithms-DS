// Arrays -> allow cache locality (which makes it faster to access memory since its right next to each other)
// Linked Lists -> does not contain ordered memory but is more dynamic (keep adding to list where array is static/dynamic but memory is limited until doubled)

// Arrays: never want to build Queues with an array always Linked Lists since arrays have indexes associated (arrays are O(n) since all the indexes would have be shift over one space).
// Linked Lists: O(1) since all we have is a pointer to head and tail and all we need to do is remove head and next up becomes head
