Graph Notes:

- One of the most useful and most used DS in Computer Science when it comes to modeling real life.
- Set of values that are related in a pear-wise fashion (Connections to different nodes).
- Each item is called a Node or Vertex and are connected Edges.
- Graphs are great at representing links and real world data to connected things (Facebook, Amazon, Google Maps, friendships, family trees, networks, WWW, roads, etc).

Types of Graphs:

    1. Directed
    - One way street (can go only one way)
    - Twitter is more directed (people can follow but you do not have to)

    2. Undirected
    - Highway between two cities
    - FB would have an undirected graph

    3. Weighted
    - With graphs you can have information in the edges (Google Maps)

    4. Unweighted
    - No information in the edges

    5. Cyclic
    - When you can go from one node to another and back
    - Common within Weighted Graphs (Google Maps)

    6. Acyclic
    - When you can go from one node to another but not back

INTERVIEW TIPS:
- Not as big of a topic during interviews due to the amount of time to discuss and overly complex but doesn't mean it's not possible to be asked.
- Types of Graphs are still important, how to create and hold data in graphs.
