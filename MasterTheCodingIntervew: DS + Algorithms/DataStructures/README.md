### Data Structures ###

**What is a Data Structure?**

 - Data Structure is a collection of values.  Values can have relationships among them and can have functions applied to them.  Each one is different in what it can do and best used for.
 - Each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.  We have a handful of data structures that cover our need to store different data.

- CPU: Does the actual work inside the computer which accesses the RAM and Storage.  It has access to RAM a lot faster whereas Storage is slower.

- RAM: Variables are stored in Random Access Memory (memory is deleted once laptop is turned off).

- Storage: Video files, music, documents (persistent data when laptop is turned off).

**Data Structures:**
 - Arrays
 - Stacks
 - Linked Lists
 - Hash Tables
 - Trees
 - Tries
 - Queues
 - Graphs

    Type of Actions used:
     - Insertion: adding items to memory
     - Deletion: deleting items to memory
     - Traversal: access each data item once to be processed
     - Searching: find data item location to see if it exists
     - Sorting: having data that is sorted
     - Access: how do we access the data

**Algorithms:**
 - Sorting
 - Dynamic Programming
 - BFS + DFS (Searching)
 - Recursion
